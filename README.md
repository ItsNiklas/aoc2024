# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in 2024. Probably done mostly in Python 3.13 üêç.

Keep in mind these are optimized solutions, not necessarily the one I used to solve the problem.

Rules:

- Python: No external libraries, only the standard library.
- Always a **general** solution, not just for the input. Any input should work.
- A short runtime. No brute force solutions.

Other:

- Input data handling is via the amazing [`aocd`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) library.
- Automatic execution and submission via `aocd` and [`watchexec`](https://watchexec.github.io/).
- `solutions/` contain the source files to solve the problem, one for each day. Executable to print both results. Keep in mind they are _cleaned_ solutions.
- Tiles below are generated via [aoc-tiles](https://github.com/LiquidFun/aoc_tiles).
